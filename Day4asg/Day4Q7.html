    <h4>Question 7 :</h4>
        <p>An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.<br>
        In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.<br>
        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.<br>
        Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.<br>
        For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.<br>
        P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value
        </p>
                                    
    <h4>Answer :</h4>
    <p>Check the console.</p>
